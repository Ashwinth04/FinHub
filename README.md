# Portfolio Optimization and Analysis Platform

## 📘 Overview
This is a full-stack portfolio optimization and analysis platform designed for individual investors and finance enthusiasts.  
It enables users to:
- Create and manage investment portfolios.
- Analyze risk and portfolio metrics.
- Run ML-based portfolio optimizations.
- Monitor sentiment trends for assets using NLP models.
- View comprehensive analytics and insights in an interactive UI.

The system follows a modular, microservice-inspired design for scalability and fault tolerance.

## 🚀 Features
### 🧾 Portfolio Management
- Secure user authentication and session handling.
- CRUD operations for assets in each user’s portfolio.
- Real-time valuation updates based on live stock prices.

### 📊 Risk Analysis
- Calculates advanced risk metrics:
  - Value at Risk (VaR)
  - Conditional VaR (CVaR)
  - Volatility, Sharpe Ratio, etc.
- Supports Monte Carlo simulations for probabilistic risk estimation.

### 🧠 ML Optimization
- Implements **Markowitz’s Portfolio Optimization** model.
- Suggests optimal portfolio weights under the current market scenario.
- Designed to integrate advanced ML models later.

### 💬 Sentiment Analysis
- Uses NLP models (TensorFlow + FastAPI backend) to evaluate market sentiment.
- Fetches and caches sentiment data for portfolio assets.
- Aggregates sentiment results and visualizes trends.

### ⚙️ System Design & Architecture
- **Frontend**: React + Vite  
- **Backend**: Node.js (REST APIs for CRUD, coordination, and user management)  
- **Risk Engine**: Python service for risk metrics and simulations  
- **Sentiment Engine**: Python + FastAPI service for sentiment and ML inference  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / MongoDB (for persistent portfolio storage)  
- **Caching Layer**: Redis (for sentiment, prices, analytics, and snapshots)  
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ (optional; for async heavy computations)  
- **Reverse Proxy / Load Balancer**: NGINX

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

### 🗂 Current Containers
| Container | Purpose |
|------------|----------|
| `frontend` | React + Vite app for user UI |
| `server` | Node.js API handling CRUD, auth, coordination |
| `risk-engine` | Computes risk metrics and simulations |
| `sentiment-api` | Runs NLP inference and sentiment aggregation |
| *(optional)* `redis` | Caching layer |
| *(optional)* `nginx` | Reverse proxy and load balancing |

Each container runs independently and communicates via HTTP or message queues.

## 🔁 Data Flow

1. **User Authentication** → User logs in; session stored (optional Redis).
2. **Portfolio CRUD** → Node.js service updates DB and invalidates cache keys:
   - `dashboard:user:<id>`
   - `risk:portfolio:<id>`
   - `optimization:portfolio:<id>`
3. **Risk Analysis** → Node.js calls Risk Engine API → Results cached.
4. **Optimization** → Node.js triggers ML model → Stores weights in Redis.
5. **Sentiment Analysis** → Node.js requests sentiment scores from Sentiment API → Cached by asset.
6. **Frontend Dashboard** → Fetches precomputed data (from Redis when possible).

## ⚡ Redis Caching Strategy

| Data | Key Pattern | TTL | Purpose |
|------|--------------|-----|----------|
| Sentiment Data | `sentiment:<symbol>` | 15–30 mins | Avoid repeated ML inference |
| Stock Prices | `price:<symbol>` | 30–60 sec | Avoid repeated API calls (e.g., yfinance) |
| Risk Metrics | `risk:portfolio:<id>` | 15 mins | Cache heavy computations |
| Optimization Results | `optimization:portfolio:<id>` | 15–30 mins | Cache optimization outputs |
| Dashboard Summary | `dashboard:user:<id>` | 5–15 mins | Speed up portfolio loading |
| Portfolio Snapshot | `portfolio:latest:user:<id>` | Manual invalidation | Quick access for analysis |
| Job Status (Async) | `job:status:<job_id>` | Until job complete | Track async tasks |

## 🧩 Observability & Monitoring
**Metrics to monitor:**
- CPU, memory, and network per container  
- API latency and error rate (p95, p99)  
- Redis hit/miss ratio, memory usage  
- Risk & optimization job runtimes  
- Monte Carlo simulation duration  
- User request throughput and error logs  

**Recommended Stack:**
- Prometheus + Grafana for metrics  
- Loki or ELK stack for logs  
- OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing

## 🧰 Tech Stack Summary
| Component | Technology |
|------------|-------------|
| Frontend | React, Vite, Tailwind |
| Backend | Node.js, Express |
| Risk Engine | Python (NumPy, Pandas) |
| Sentiment Engine | Python, FastAPI, TensorFlow |
| Cache | Redis |
| Proxy | NGINX |
| Message Queue | RabbitMQ (optional) |
| Database | PostgreSQL / MongoDB |

- Replace Markowitz model with deep reinforcement learning–based optimization.  
- Add multi-user collaboration and portfolio sharing.  
- Implement automated alerts based on risk thresholds.  
- Enhance observability with complete distributed tracing.
